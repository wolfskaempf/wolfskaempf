Hi! 👋 I'm Tom. I'm passionate about using Python to improve the world.

Since 2015 I have been developing web applications using Python on a voluntary basis, amongst others for the European Youth Parliament, where I've also been a member of the board of the German national committee between 2016 and 2018.

To date, my largest project [GA Statistics](https://github.com/eyp-developers/statistics) has been used to visualise debates and voting procedures at over 250 events in 40 different countries. During the pandemic it was an essential tool for the continued operation of the events of the European Youth Parliament.
